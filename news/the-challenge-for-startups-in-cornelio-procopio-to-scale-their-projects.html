    <h1 class="section-title" style="text-align:center;">The Challenge for Startups in Cornélio Procópio to Scale Their Projects</h1>
    <p style="opacity:0.8; margin-bottom:40px; text-align:center;">By <strong>Renan Ricardo Pereira Lima</strong> • November 11, 2025</p>

    <p>Cornélio Procópio, a key city in Northern Paraná, Brazil, has emerged in recent years as a fertile ground for innovation, technology, and entrepreneurship. Initiatives such as the <strong>CPCity Award</strong>, <strong>Sisgama Lab</strong>, and other local networks supporting entrepreneurs reveal the creative potential and collaborative strength of the community. However, when it comes to <strong>scaling projects</strong>, startups in the region still face a number of challenges that limit sustainable growth.</p>

    <h2>🌱 An Ecosystem in Formation</h2>
    <p>Despite remarkable progress, Cornélio Procópio’s innovation ecosystem is still in a maturing phase. There is a lack of strong structures for <strong>acceleration, investment, and mentorship</strong>, forcing many entrepreneurs to seek support in larger hubs like Londrina, Maringá, or Curitiba. This decentralization slows development and makes it difficult to build local strategic connections.</p>

    <h2>💸 Limited Access to Capital and Angel Investors</h2>
    <p><strong>Lack of access to venture capital</strong> remains one of the greatest barriers. Investors are still cautious about funding businesses located outside major urban centers. Many startups in Cornélio Procópio rely on personal savings or small public grants, limiting their ability to test scalable business models and attract top talent.</p>

    <h2>🤝 Weak Market Connections</h2>
    <p>Another critical issue is the <strong>limited connection with large companies and universities</strong> in open innovation processes. Although there are promising ideas and solutions, the difficulty in validating products in real environments prevents these startups from gaining traction. Strengthening partnerships with the regional business sector would be a key step toward overcoming this barrier.</p>

    <h2>🧭 A Cultural Gap in Risk-Taking Entrepreneurship</h2>
    <p>In regions where traditional sectors like agriculture and commerce dominate, innovative entrepreneurship is still perceived as uncertain. Many startup founders in Cornélio Procópio face cultural and social resistance, making it harder to persist in an environment characterized by high risk and constant change.</p>

    <h2>🌐 Opportunities and Paths Forward</h2>
    <p>Despite these challenges, the outlook is optimistic. Programs like <strong>Sisgama Lab</strong> and <strong>Sisgama LaunchPad</strong> are building bridges between innovation and investment. Furthermore, events such as the <strong>CPCity Award</strong> provide visibility for local solutions and help position Cornélio Procópio on the regional innovation map.</p>

    <blockquote>“Startups in Cornélio Procópio have already proven their creativity — now the challenge is to turn great ideas into scalable, sustainable businesses.” — Renan Ricardo Pereira Lima</blockquote>

    <p>With greater institutional support, stronger mentorship networks, and a more risk-tolerant innovation culture, the city has the potential to become a <strong>reference in decentralized entrepreneurship in Paraná</strong>.</p>
