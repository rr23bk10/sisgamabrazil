    <p style="opacity:0.8; margin-bottom:40px; text-align:center;">By <strong>Renan Ricardo Pereira Lima</strong> • November 2, 2025</p>

    <p>The <strong>Sisgama Program</strong> is consolidating itself as one of the leading innovation initiatives in Cornélio Procópio and its region. 
    Dedicated to supporting startups, entrepreneurs, and creators, the program stands out for its gamified methodology and the way it merges technology, governance, and community collaboration.</p>

    <h2>Open and collective innovation</h2>
    <p>Since its inception, Sisgama has aimed to be more than an incubator — it is an open innovation ecosystem connecting people, ideas, and investment. 
    Its goal is to empower local entrepreneurs, lower the barriers to the tech market, and promote real impact through innovation.</p>

    <blockquote>“Sisgama was created so that innovation is no longer a privilege, but a collective practice that transforms local realities.” — Renan Ricardo Pereira Lima</blockquote>

    <h2>Projects with impact</h2>
    <p>Among the supported startups are projects focused on digital public management, tech education, urban sustainability, and digital inclusion. 
    A highlight goes to teams using the <strong>SBR Token</strong> — Sisgama’s digital asset — as a tool for engagement and decentralized governance.</p>

    <h2>Recognition and the future</h2>
    <p>The program also promotes the <strong>CPCity Award</strong>, honoring projects that drive social and technological progress in the city. 
    The initiative has been attracting young talent, universities, and investors who believe in building a collaborative innovation ecosystem in northern Paraná.</p>

    <p>Sisgama shows that when innovation is born from community, it becomes more authentic, sustainable, and transformative.</p>
