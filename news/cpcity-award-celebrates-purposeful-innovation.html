    <h1 class="section-title" style="text-align:center;">CPCity Award Celebrates Purposeful Innovation</h1>
    <p style="opacity:0.8; margin-bottom:40px; text-align:center;">By <strong>Renan Ricardo Pereira Lima</strong> • November 1, 2025</p>

    <p>The <strong>CPCity Award</strong> has emerged as one of the main initiatives recognizing innovation with purpose in Cornélio Procópio. 
    Organized by the <strong>HoodCrowd Valley</strong> community in partnership with the <strong>Sisgama ecosystem</strong>, the award celebrates startups, collectives, and initiatives transforming the city through technology and collaboration.</p>

    <h2>Innovation with human purpose</h2>
    <p>More than an award, CPCity is a movement — it reinforces the importance of developing innovation rooted in human, social, and community values. 
    Submissions are evaluated based on impact, originality, and social relevance, rewarding those who innovate not just for profit, but for meaningful transformation.</p>

    <blockquote>“The CPCity Award is about giving back to the city what technology does best: connecting people and transforming realities.” — Renan Ricardo Pereira Lima</blockquote>

    <h2>A space for co-creation</h2>
    <p>The award was designed to inspire a new generation of entrepreneurs to act ethically and collaboratively. 
    Instead of a traditional competition, CPCity fosters an environment of co-creation — where participants share knowledge, experiences, and build solutions together.</p>

    <p>Applications are open until the end of November, with results to be announced in December. 
    Winners will be recognized during the <strong>Hello Universe</strong> event, a symbol of how purpose-driven innovation is shaping the future of Cornélio Procópio.</p>
